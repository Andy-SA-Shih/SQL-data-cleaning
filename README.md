# SQL-data-cleaning
This project showcases my skills in SQL data cleaning in SQLite Studio.

## Data source
- I downloaded the original CSV data file from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bvanntruong/housing-sql-project. This dataset contains information about housing sales in Nashville, TN.
- I also referred to the .sql file from https://www.kaggle.com/code/bvanntruong/nashville-housing-sql-data-cleaning for my data cleaning tasks. However, since the author might do the data cleaning in another Database management system, I almost wrote all my own codes. 

## Tasks 
- In the .sql files, you can find the below data cleaning tasks:
* Import a CSV file to an SQL table
* Convert a TEXT type column to represent dates
* To identify and handle missing values
* Use aliases to perform tasks requiring the help of self-join tables
* String processing using SUBSTR, INSTR, and the nested functions of them
* Check and delete duplicates
